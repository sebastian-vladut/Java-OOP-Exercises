## Exercise 8: Simple Game Character System
### **Requirements:**
Create a Character class that includes attributes such as health, attack power,
and defense. Extend this class into Warrior, Mage, and Archer, where each
character has a unique attack method. Implement a simple battle simulation
where two characters fight, and logic is applied to determine the winner based
on their attack and defense values.
