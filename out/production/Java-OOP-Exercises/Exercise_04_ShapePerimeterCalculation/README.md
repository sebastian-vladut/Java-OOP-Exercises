## Exercise 4: Shape Perimeter Calculation
### **Requirements:**
Define a base Shape class with a method to calculate the perimeter of a shape.
This class should be extended by Circle, Rectangle, and Square classes. Each
class will override the method to calculate the perimeter based on its shape’s
specific formula. Demonstrate polymorphism by calculating the perimeter based
on the shape’s class type.
