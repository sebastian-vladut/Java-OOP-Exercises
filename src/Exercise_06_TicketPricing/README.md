## Exercise 6: Ticket Pricing
### **Requirements:**
Design a ticket pricing system by creating a Ticket class with a method to calculate the price of a ticket. Extend this class into AdultTicket, ChildTicket,
and SeniorTicket subclasses, where each subclass has its own pricing logic.
The system must use polymorphism to calculate the ticket price based on the
ticket type, ensuring the correct pricing logic is applied. To correctly provide
the ticket type, information about the person should be read from system I/O.
