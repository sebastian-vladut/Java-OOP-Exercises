## Exercise 1: Bank Account System
### **Requirements:**
You will create a BankAccount class that includes private fields for an account
number, balance, and account holderâ€™s name. The system must provide public
methods for depositing and withdrawing money, as well as checking the balance.
Withdrawals should not be allowed if the balance is insufficient, demonstrating
encapsulation by restricting direct access to the balance. The user should be
able to withdraw/deposit money via I/O.
