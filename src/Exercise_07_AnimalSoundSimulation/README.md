## Exercise 7: Animal Sound Simulation
### **Requirements:**
Implement an Animal class with a method makeSound(), which outputs the
sound the animal makes. Extend this class to create specific animal classes
like Dog, Cat, and Bird, each of which overrides the makeSound() method to
provide the sound that corresponds to the animal. Use polymorphism to invoke
the correct sound for each animal at runtime.
