## Exercise 2: Arithmetic Operations
### **Requirements:**
Create a Calculator base class with a method to perform an operation between
two numbers. Extend this class into Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication,
and Division subclasses, where each class will perform its respective operation.
The user can input from keyboard the operation (e.g. 1 + 2) and based on the
input, the system should instantiate the right object to perform the operation.
