## Exercise 3: Employee Salary Calculation
### **Requirements:**
Develop an Employee class that has encapsulated fields for the employee’s name,
ID, and base salary. This class should be extended by Manager and Developer
subclasses. Managers should receive bonuses, and developers should receive
overtime pay. The system must ensure that salary calculation is based on the
type of employee, with methods to access and update employee information
securely using encapsulation.
